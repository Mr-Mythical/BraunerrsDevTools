# BraunerrsDevTools

A toolkit for World of Warcraft addon and WeakAura creators.

> ⚠️ **Early Development**: This addon is in early development. Features may change and bugs may occur.

## Dev Mode

The core feature of this addon is Dev Mode:
- Lets you use Ctrl+R (and optionally other modifier+R combos) to reload your UI, without interfering with your normal keybinds
- All reload keybinds are ignored while you are typing in chat or edit boxes (prevents accidental reloads while chatting and can be toggled in the options).
- Automatically enables BugSack error popups (if installed)
- Sets your character AFK to avoid interruptions

Toggle Dev Mode at any time with `/bdt` or by creating a keybind in the settings.
